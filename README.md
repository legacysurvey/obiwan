# obiwan
An extension of the legacypipe/Tractor pipeline for the [DECALS, MzLS, and BASS Legacy Surveys](http://legacysurvey.org/dr4/description). This package injects artificial stars and galaxy-targets (ELGs, LRGs, and QSOs) into individual images for uncerstanding imaging systematic for [DESI](https://desi.lbl.gov). It re-runs the legacypipe/Tractor pipeline on the modified images and the resulting _simulated_ Tractor catalogues can be used as a Data Release.

# Documentation
------------------

Please visit [obiwan on locally built Docs](https://legacysurvey.github.io/obiwan)

The Docs are built locally from these [instructions](https://github.com/legacysurvey/obiwan/tree/gh-pages/README.md), because the galsim install is so complicated that getting .travis.yml installing everything correctly I didn't want to repeat with the Sphinx/Read the Docs build script. The deprecated documentation is here [obiwan on Read the Docs](http://obiwan.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
